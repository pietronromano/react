# (My) Modern React from the Beginning
This is my personal version of the "Modern React from the Beginning" course by Brad Traversy on Udemy. Brad's course is an excellent resource for learning React, and I have created this repository to document my learning journey. 
It includes my own notes, code snippets, and modifications to the original course materials.
